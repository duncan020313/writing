\begin{abstract}
	Programming languages have become increasingly abstracted over time. This is because advances in hardware and compilers have eliminated the need to consider low-level elements when programming. As a result, productivity and efficiency have dramatically increased. Language models will further abstract programming languages to a higher dimension, making programming tasks easier and more efficient.
\end{abstract}

In the past, due to limited hardware performance and compilers, programmers had
to program with hardware considerations in mind. As hardware has advanced and
compilers have added numerous optimizations, most programmers no longer need to
consider hardware. Thanks to this, software development productivity has been
able to increase dramatically.

Abstraction, in other words, means that you don't have to specify concretely
how to do it. Now programmers don't have to specify concretely what sorting
algorithm to use, how to manage memory, how to handle network communication,
etc.

Language models will enable programmers to program declaratively at a very high
level of abstraction. Compilers of existing programming languages translated
declarative elements into procedural machine code according to predetermined
rules. However, language models can understand user intent and convert it into
procedural algorithms even in situations where there are no predetermined
rules.

However, to ensure correctness, there must be a guarantee that the converted
algorithm is correct. In the case of existing compilers, this is guaranteed
through numerous tests or verification techniques. However, since static
inspection is virtually impossible for language models, it is necessary to
dynamically check whether the converted algorithm meets the user's
instructions. I would like to guarantee this through \textsc{Expecto} and
create a new programming language and compiler based on this.
